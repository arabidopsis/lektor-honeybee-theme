# Lektor Theme honeybee example site

Describe your example site here. A symlink is already set up pointing to the rest of the theme. This will need a minimum of some content in `contents/` so the example will have some pages to render. You should try to set up this example site to showcase your theme, and not have too much that is extraneous.
